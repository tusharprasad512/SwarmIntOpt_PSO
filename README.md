# SwarmIntOpt_PSO
To implement a Multiple Modular Approach to Time-Series prediction using Online sequential learning algorithm and optimizing it using Swarm intelligence.

We built an extreme learning algorithm and tested it on Mackey-Glass dataset. Tried optimizing it using Particle Swarm Optimization.

Wrote a survey paper on the project : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8524481
